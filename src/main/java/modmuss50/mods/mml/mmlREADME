MMl = Modmuss Mod Loader

The point of using mml is to make mods that are minecraft version independent. MML will require an update to the newest version of minecraft.
MML will be running of forge for the moment so I will have to wait for forge to update till I can update MML.

Goals:
    Version independent mods.
    Mods can be loaded and unloaded without a game restart(Might be limited to commands and stuff)
        Mods can be downloaded from a server(Security is the big thing that needs work)
        Mods can be disabled/enabled on a per world basis
        Mods cannot reference minecraft or FML/Forge classes only mml ones.
        Mods can be server/client/universal.
    Easy central location to download mods from(MML website?) could be done in-game?
